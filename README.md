I'm a big believer in Free Open Sourced Software (FOSS). Though this is not software, nor is there a paid/free version of my site, I still wanted to give the source code that runs my site to be shown to the web!

Pages in the `/sql` folder are pages that display a "preview" of what the actual page is supposed to look like, with undefined values. These pages rely on the SQL server on my hosting service, which is not allowed on GitHub.io.
